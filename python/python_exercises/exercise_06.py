# Constants Naming
# Create a constant variable for PI and assign it a value of 3.14159. Print its value.
PI = 3.14159
print(PI)
# In pyhthon we are using UPPERCASE letters to show constatnt variables.
# Actuully there is no 'constant variable' concept in python. Like Javascript const PI = 3.14159
# But this is just convention to understanding other developers.
