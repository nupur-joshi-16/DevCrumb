# tuples in Python

tup_1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(tup_1)
print(type(tup_1))
tup_2 = (1)
print(type(tup_2))
tup_3 = (1, )
print(type(tup_3))

#tup_1[0]= 999 tuples are immutable


# What is a difference between list ans tuple?
# tuple is immutable and list is mutable. We cannot change the values in tuples but we can change values in list.
